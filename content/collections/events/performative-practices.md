Artists Kate Burke and Jessica Swank enter into a dialogue that examines what it means to encounter digital technology so intimately and consistently, using labor as a mechanism to reiterate our interactions with it.'

            text: "As humans, our day to day encounters with digital technology prove to be both intimate and redundant. The ways in which we respond and interact with technology are often ritualistic, hypnotic and yet tedious. Repetitive thoughts, the collecting of physical detritus, and the pain associated with severing (or mending) the physical self, are all private, intimate labors. Today, these inherently intimate and human labors are recontextualized through technology and machinery: they are given a public platform, and the formerly private work of being human is now on full, technological display. Are these actions meditative or addictive? At this point, humans and machines no longer exist at opposite poles. They reside on a spectrum, with much overlap between them. How do we understand our human selves in this new, non-human context? The tedious labor employed in the creation of many of these pieces not only mimics the ways in which we interact with technology, but also exist as a form of reclamation over what it means to be human and the intimate losses of ourselves from the tedious and relentless experience of technology and the machine.\_"

              text: 'Having grown up in Southern Baptist culture, the questions of control, sin, and self-acceptance recurred as themes throughout my development. What was truly “holy”? What did it mean when you saw Southern hospitality swapped for power and oppression? These metaphysical questions ultimately led me away from Christianity into a deeper desire to understand spirituality through the lens of human evolution: what emphasis did environment and cultural context have on my emotional, mental, and spiritual disposition? Why were so many people who called themselves Christians devout but deeply unhappy? Why was I so deeply unhappy? '

              text: 'My obsession with the internet and its spiritual effect on humans ultimately led me to discover the concept of “Metaphysical poetry:” a genre of poetry that muses philosophical concepts through intense and dissonant imagery, complex metaphors, and perhaps even whimsical or contradictory language to pontificate about the human experience. With the social sphere of the internet being shepherded by the company “Meta” and my bend towards craft to make my ideas “physical”--I use the traditional, intimate, and intentional technologies of the human experience (textiles and ceramics) to dissect my philosophical discussions about the fleeting yet pervasive effects of cellular devices and other ethereal digital platforms on Homo Sapiens. Does our time on the Internet provide a mental framework that mirrors the magnitude of effects that an intense religious upbringing can have on a person? How easy is it for me to fall into that framework, and how do I wiggle away if I want out? By switching from ethereal textile works to heavy ceramic mosaics, I can empathetically force the viewers into bodily responding to the weight, heaviness, or intangible nature of a spiritual or philosophical idea, paving way for a greater connection with our felt sense and ability to critically tap into a side of ourselves that is often shut away in today’s society.'

              text: "This work addresses the relationship between humans and digital technology from a personal perspective. Intersections of organic and synthetic materials function as a metaphor for the blurred boundaries between humans and machines. By utilizing various methods of self-extension, fragmentation, and recontextualization, I attempt to depict the merging of these entities. Many of the pieces include remnants of myself or those close to me, abject traces of our own existence. Flesh-like membranes represent extensions of myself and use my own skin tone as a form of self-portraiture. Combined with both natural and manufactured objects, I view these works as relatives to the cyborg. Technology allows for the duplication and extension of the self, and simultaneously aids us in the subversion of labor for the sake of convenience. In response, I've created works in which the materials and structures that are present may feel familiar, yet entirely separate from the human form. When examined closely, the systems between the technological and biological world are not so different. It is easy to blur the lines between them when the digital world is carefully modeled to mimic that with which we are familiar. In documenting the interplay between material, gesture, and my own fragmented body, these works construct a narrative of interdependence, tension, disembodiment, and inseparability."
