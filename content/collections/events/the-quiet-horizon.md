            text: ' brings together works by local Greenville artists, Steve Courchaine, Meredith Piper, Alexander Rouse, Jonathan Bolton, Olivia Perrault, and Darius Ollison, each offering a unique interpretation of landscapes where the vanishing point leads not only to a visual destination but to emotional release. Through drawing, painting, and photography, these artists explore how distance, openness, and the suggestion of infinity can foster mindfulness, calm, and a renewed sense of purpose.'
