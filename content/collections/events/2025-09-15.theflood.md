            text: 'Melissa Haviland’s The Flood draws on the long history of “bluing,” a process in which blue dyes were added to paper and textiles to counteract yellowing which improved perceived quality of the material. From 15th-century European paper made from worn rags to the more modern blue-tinted laundry brighteners, bluing has long suggested improvement, and value—even when it only disguised what may lay beneath.'

            text: 'In The Flood, Haviland reimagines this history through the lens of climate disaster. The towering, immersive installations evoke the sensation of being swept away, as if the ocean had flooded through the space. This work embodies both the chaos of everyday stresses, bedtimes, deadlines; and the immense weight of global crises: climate refugees, rising seas, water scarcity, and environmental collapse. The blue in The Flood echoes the promise of enhancement, even as we are submerged in questions of survival: how do we stay afloat?'

              text: 'I am an installation artist that obsesses in multiples, using them to fill space and surround the viewer. I push the medium of printmaking—pulling the prints from the wall and indulging in repetition and pattern. I am drawn to the concept of the multiple to reference the reiteration of objects and ideas in our culture. My current artwork correlates water with emotions, reveling in blue, a color that is at once melancholy and calming. It is inspired by ideas of being swept away by the sea of life, as if the ocean just flooded through your home and swept it away. It considers the feelings of chaos that enters our daily lives combined with larger cultural issues of climate change. How do we manage all this?'
