              text: ' explores human propensity to observe, discover, and then control space, both terrestrial and cosmic. Ana Vizcarra Rankin’s paintings challenge the supposed objectivity of maps, revealing how they reflect power structures and shape our understanding of place. By reimagining erased histories and offering alternative perspectives—such as unconventional map orientations and cosmic reinterpretations—she invites viewers to question dominant narratives and consider new ways of seeing. Lindsay Godin’s Futurisms photography series examines humanity’s enduring fascination with uncharted territories, from early celestial observations to modern space exploration. Her work highlights how technological advancements—such as telescopes and rockets—extend our reach beyond Earth, transforming observation into an act of possession. By exploring the tension between curiosity and control, Futurisms reflects on the relentless human impulse to claim the unknown.'

              text: 'Futurisms (2019-present) is an on-going body of work that aims to encapsulate mankind’s preoccupation with uncharted territories. Dating back to the earliest sightings by ancient civilizations to the present day, mankind has continuously observed, imprinted, and has attempted to dominate unclaimed landscapes. As humankind evolved, this preoccupation expanded to extraterrestrial territories due to the invention of the telescope and the advancement of the rocket machine. Today, this machine is now a sophisticated extension of mankind’s intellect: an artificial observer yearning to explore territories which are beyond mankind’s physical abilities. The images in Futurisms shed light on the endless continuum of mankind’s propensity and instinctive motive to ultimately claim the unexplored territories beyond planet Earth.'

Born in Uruguay and raised in both South and North America, Rankin creates perceptual art that investigates the intersections of science, history, and culture. Her work, which ranges from monumental canvases to delicate, diminutive objects, considers events that occur in subatomic spacetime all the way to global and cosmic perspectives.'

              text: 'Maps are never neutral. They reflect a specific point of view, which shapes what they ultimately communicate. My work interrogates these perspectives, challenging narratives imposed by colonial powers and imagining a reality where erasure gives way to reinterpretation. This inquiry is grounded in the human experience — ever evolving, imperfect yet perfectible, flawed but full of potential.'

              text: 'In my quest for balance, I am drawn to alternative views of our world: maps with Antarctica at the top, subatomic explosions that mimic unfurling ferns, and dark spaces filled with renamed constellations, framed by developing horizons. The availability of information and the ways it is conveyed fascinate me. Inherent biases, such as North/South orientation, or interpretive methods like false-color rendering, provide a starting point for exploring our relationship to visual language and physicality.'

              text: 'Amid the extraordinary complexity of the universe, our planet stands alone as a living ecosystem. I want to inspire wonder and action: to encourage people to revel in dark skies and see the stars, to plant more trees than we harvest, to advocate for water clean enough to swim in, drink, and sustain biodiversity. My artwork translates these aspirations into a visual language that expresses what my words cannot.'
