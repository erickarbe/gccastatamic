                text: 'Lindsay Godin (b.1992) was born in central New Jersey and got her MA & MFA in Studio Arts (emphasis in Photography) at the University of Iowa in 2018. She researches photography curricula and is a fine arts documentary photographer. Her photography sheds awareness of contemporary cultural norms and political values and how these effect society on the macro scale. Lindsay was the recipient of PDN’s 2017 Photo Annual Award for her student work. Her work is also on permanent collection at the Albright-Knox Gallery in New York and with other work having been exhibited nationally and internationally. As of August 2020, Lindsay is the Photography Coordinator and an Assistant Professor of Photography and Design at Valdosta State University in Georgia.'

                text: 'Futurisms (2019-present) is an on-going body of work that aims to encapsulate mankind’s preoccupation with uncharted territories. Dating back to the earliest sightings by ancient civilizations to the present day, mankind has continuously observed, imprinted, and has attempted to dominate unclaimed landscapes. As humankind evolved, this preoccupation expanded to extraterrestrial territories due to the invention of the telescope and the advancement of the rocket machine. Today, this machine is now a sophisticated extension of mankind’s intellect: an artificial observer yearning to explore territories which are beyond mankind’s physical abilities. The images in Futurisms shed light on the endless continuum of mankind’s propensity and instinctive motive to ultimately claim the unexplored territories beyond planet Earth.'
