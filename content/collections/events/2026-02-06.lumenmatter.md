            text: 'centers on solar imagery, geology, and abstraction as both material and meaning. In this solo show, Molly Kaderka explores light as a formative force that connects geology, astronomy, and human perception. Drawing from the history of landscape painting while working through abstraction, she uses traditional ebru marbling techniques to create layered surfaces that echo geological formations shaped by slow, natural processes. These works pair earthly forms with references to celestial bodies, reimagining the horizon as a space where land and sky meet and where human awareness briefly intersects.'

            text: 'Light moves quietly but persistently throughout the exhibition, revealing layers, activating surfaces, and illuminating shadows. Kaderka’s process embraces both structure and unpredictability, allowing materials to behave in ways that mirror natural forces beyond human control. '

              text: 'Molly Kaderka is an interdisciplinary artist working in painting, drawing, and printmaking whose practice explores the intersections of geology, astronomy, and human relationships to land. Drawing inspiration from natural phenomena and deep time, her work translates material histories and celestial references into layered, abstract compositions that reflect on scale, perception, and the fragility of human presence within larger natural systems. Kaderka holds a BFA in Painting and Art History from the Kansas City Art Institute and an MFA in Painting from the Rhode Island School of Design. Her work has been exhibited nationally in solo and group exhibitions, including at Haw Contemporary, Jamestown Art Center, Morgan Lehman Gallery, Utah Museum of Contemporary Art, and Newport Art Museum, and she has received multiple fellowships and awards. She is currently a Professor of Art at Wake Forest University.'
