        text: "Chromatic Catharsis documents my artistic and emotional evolution over the past years. Starting from a place of intense anxiety and depression, my early works reflect a struggle with self-worth and the weight of mental anguish. These pieces, often rendered in acrylic on modest canvases, serve as raw, unfiltered expressions of those challenging times. As my journey progressed, so did my art. 'Feelings change' is a truth I've lived, and this exhibition charts that change. The newer works, created with oil paints and on larger scales, burst with vibrancy, movement, and a renewed sense of self. They represent freedom from self-harm, a celebration of inner joy, and the reclamation of my inner child. Through 'Chromatic Catharsis,' I invite you to witness the healing power of art and the transformative journey from darkness to light."
