            text: "Current GCCA Studio Artists were invited to share work about their relationship to place and how that bond informs their art. These artists considered what keeps them rooted, such as memory, process, and location. They also reflected on what it means to reach upward; to grow and explore. Much like a tree canopy growing toward the sun, artists stretch and change to follow new ideas, take creative risks, and respond to the world around them. Each artist was encouraged to respond in their own way, keeping in mind their rooting in this community and the potential directions their creative canopies may grow.\_"
