Across history, artists have drawn from myth and legend to reflect on human fears, desires, and power structures. From the Renaissance to Neoclassicism, Romanticism to Surrealism, and into the present, these recurring narratives offer both comfort and creative ground for reinvention.'

Myths provide symbolic frameworks that make sense of chaos, offering stability amid uncertainty. This exhibition continues that lineage, showing how contemporary artists, particularly millennials shaped by conflict, recession, and climate crisis, reinterpret historical and mythological stories to confront modern instability.'

As a self-taught artist, I approach art as a way to understand myself and the world around me through vulnerable experiences that I want to create as a puzzle for viewers to piece together. I’m especially drawn to themes of iconography and putting on a persona to tell my stories while I often let my intuition lead the creative process. My work isn’t about perfection, it’s about honesty, experimentation, and storytelling.Through my art, I aim to create a space where people can see parts of themselves, feel something deeply, or ask questions they hadn’t considered before. Art has always been my first language, and I use it to communicate what I can’t always say out loud.'

One character, the Krivopeta, or the “wild woman of the woods”, can control the weather and determine the success of those who seek her help. They have green hair and backward feet. If a Krivopeta is respected, she bestows good results. If she is angered, she’ll fallow crops, send storms and even kidnap children.'

The women in these portraits are often not identified, or the photos are given descriptive titles such as, “Woman in front of a shanty” or “Farm woman in the cotton fields”. I feel that this type of treatment degrades them even more.'

These women are showcased in, what most likely, was the most difficult period of their lives. Hungry, overworked, overwrought and hopeless, their lives were effective in enacting anti-poverty aid programs and legislation throughout the country. However, these portraits also show how devastated many families and individuals were at the time, but they remain frozen in that space. A great deal of these women were alone while male members of their families were off looking for work in other areas. Often they were living on small incomes, taking in boarders, working in or outside of the home and trying to provide for their children, parents and siblings without little or any help from others. They were strong, powerful women in their own right.'

                text: 'Hecate Unwinds draws its reference from the Greek goddess of magic, characters from Adventure Time, and the turmoil of the feminine experience. The idea of the “maiden, mother, and crone” has always been a reminder to me of the progression and expiration of femininity. But as I’ve grown into and beyond that side of myself, I’ve learned to appreciate all the phases of life and growth as they pass through us. In all kinds of media, I am fascinated by powerful characters with multiple, often conflicting, characteristics or traits. I found this in the Adventure Time characters “grob” “gob” “glob” and “grod”. They are a deity that has magical powers with a four sided head, not too dissimilar to hecate. Some of the visual elements were inspired by this character.'

                text: 'Another noteworthy visual element of this piece are the sigils I designed, carved into the chest of the figures. As part of my recent creative/spiritual practice, I have started to incorporate elements of magic into my work. This often informs my choices of color, symbolism and intentional choices like the use of sigils. I found that this inclusion was particularly fitting for a piece that is heavily influenced by the goddess of magic. The goal of my work is to take viewers outside of the often bleak reality around us and offer a glimpse into something supernatural, informed by my personal experience. Along with many of my other pieces, this one heavily wrestles with gender and identity. Although these are general themes, I think that makes the work more relatable to those who have a similar experience.'

Those characters are famous for being villains and monsters in our founding stories. Circe was a powerful witch, exiled on an island, who transformed unfortunate sailors into pigs. Medusa was one of the Gorgons, a winged woman with snakes for hair, whose appearance was so hideous that anyone who looked at her would turn to stone. Both female characters are antagonists of our male heroes, Odysseus and Perseus respectively. However, if one interprets them as protagonists instead, the story changes completely.'

And how beautiful is it that the strength of these women survived millenniums to finally get understood!'

I was inspired by the art of Artemesia Gentileschi, a 17th century Italian baroque painter who revisited Christian stories with a female gaze. A perfect example is her painting “Susanna and the elders” from 1610.'

Born the same year as Roe v. Wade legalized a woman's right for privacy under the 14th Amendment, I stand today with less rights as a woman in the United States. I stand as a mother, friend, aunt, daughter, wife and advocate for women's rights fearing how long this nightmare will last. These pills were made in response to a story my mother told me on several occasions of how a friend's mother told a handful of her girlfriends how not to get pregnant in the early 1960's, \" You hold an Aspirin between your knees\". As I anxiously wait for the laws to make sense, I will make my \"Aspirin\" in support of my health, my daughter's health, niece, sister-in-law, students, friends and any other woman in the world to hold their body's as their own untethered from law or any other person."

He earned a BA in Studio Art from the College of Charleston after studying Media Arts at the University of South Carolina. Following college, Nelson has dedicated himself to his painting practice, raising crops, and deepening his experience in Zen philosophy. His work has been recognized at major exhibitions, including the SC Biennial at 701 CCA, ArtFields in Lake City (where he won People’s Choice for Plein Air Painting), and the Festival of Flowers Juried Art Exhibit (Best in Show). His art reflects a commitment to addressing environmental issues with nuance and urgency, inviting viewers to consider the ways we coexist with our rapidly changing natural world. Nelson currently resides in Darlington, SC, where he continues to create art that bridges the personal and the ecological, the meditative and the urgent.'

The show featured intricately executed oil portraits and plein-air paintings, the latter created on-site at public lands across South Carolina. These plein-air works, rooted in the immediacy of nature, counterbalance the surreal and fantastical elements of his portraiture and underscore his connection to the environment. This series emerged from his work as a recipient of the South Carolina Arts Commission Emerging Artist Grant and reflects his commitment to documenting and preserving the region’s natural beauty.'

I have used creation as a purging process and would like to have a space where I can create with safety, as I currently live with my parents. Although I could argue that all my work has been made out of love in retrospect (love for the environment, love in highschool, love for my ancestral history), I would use this opportunity to hone in on moments where love has felt precarious and loving despite the conditions and environment. With the current year and the overall history of education (especially education in the South), I embody my own theme that I have set for myself (precarious love and hope). I have seen a lot of love and hope in both my work environment and my own life.  '

I find that emotional experiences often somaticize physical symptoms like tension, discomfort, or even pain. I often reflect on these felt experiences and attempt to make them tangible. My studio practice allows me to create space for my emotions, process them, express their sensorial effects, and explore facets of my identity in a cathartic and healing way.'

They act as metaphors for how we can choose to interact with our emotions: We can either bottle them up and hold them in, or we can take the lid off, let things out, and allow ourselves to be vulnerable. Over the past year, I have noticed myself holding in strong waves of emotions linked to loss and grief. But growing up as a gay man in the South, I have always contained parts of myself as an act of self-preservation in a political environment in which I often feel unwelcome.'

With visual traces of Pandora’s Jar, I want to create a timeless quality that references ancient narratives. By merging the ancient with my own contemporary practice and meaning, I hope to convey that humans have always struggled with emotional conflict; thus, letting the self-contained know that they are not alone.'

A multidisciplinary artist, she frequently utilizes objects found or inherited from family–beads, vessels, and figurines–and explores connections with those common objects to preserve relationships with family and depict the intergenerational lineage of inherited traits like trauma, mental illness, beliefs in social institutions, cultural constructs, and norms. Explorations of specific moments, vague memories, and the stories we tell ourselves challenge the division between past and present experience. Gustave was awarded a Master's in Art History and received a BFA with Honors, both from the University of Denver. She has exhibited in Germany, Colorado, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. She served as a member and Co-Director of the artist-run curatorial collective, Tiger Strikes Asteroid Greenville. She is currently an adjunct professor at Furman University."

I explore connections with common objects, found or inherited from family, to preserve relationships and depict the intergenerational lineage of traits like trauma, mental illness, beliefs in social institutions, cultural constructs, and norms. Collective memory is represented through images gleaned from the mundane, pop culture, and especially visual elements used throughout the history of art. These images function as connectors of place, memory, and stories that endure beyond a specific time and serve as a reminder of how they subconsciously construct our realities. My work explores how these reinterpretations offer a shift in our understanding of social institutions, cultural constructs, inherited norms, and our own related identity.'

The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, but each of them had four faces and four wings. Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. (Ezekiel 1:4-8)'

Each of Ezekiel’s angels had four faces: that of a human, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. There are similarly chimeric visions of dragons in art history, such as St. Michael killing the Dragon by Josse Lieferinxe and Saint George and the Dragon by Raphael, where the dragon has the head of an eagle, lion, or other animal. In these paintings I’m interested in exploring chaos, knowledge, and human limitations around knowing and judgement. I’m interested in subverting the contemporary American stereotype of angels as peaceful children, nice guys, and other benign figures. The angels I depict instead serve as a warning to those with power who would use it irresponsibly, those who see but do not understand.'

                text: 'This piece is heavily inspired by the folk art tradition. It seeks to build a private mythology around my childhood and family history. The burning church is a reference to a piece of family history on my mother’s side. The story goes that our Scottish family clan, the Clan Moffat, was locked inside their church one Sunday morning by a rival clan and burned alive. Afterwards, the remaining members adopted the motto: Spero meliora (I hope for better things). My great-grandmother, who I knew as a child, had a tartan with this motto stitched into it. This story connected with my sense as a child that my family was uniquely cursed in some way. The lack of a door on the church is a reference to The Church at Auvers by Van Gogh. For Gogh, the lack of an entrance was most likely symbolic of his rejection from the priesthood. In Childhood Landscape #1, the intention was to speak to a sense of being trapped both inside and outside the church. My father is Jewish, but converted to Calvinist Christianity before I was born. I was raised in a tiny Presbyterian church, but still participated in Jewish traditions. There was conflict and distrust between the two sides of my family in regards to the religious and cultural conflicts at hand. Also pictured in this piece are a triad of horned sperm, a reference to shame around sexuality, a weeping cow in reference to my biblical namesake’s dream interpretation to the Pharaoh, and a depiction of Satan as a snake with an exposed brain.'

The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire. (Revelation 20:11-15) As a child I was often anxious about how exactly I would justify my misdeeds when it was “my turn” at the last judgement. This piece finds equal parts humor and dread at the idea of having to morally justify your life in front of God and Humanity as an anxious classroom presentation expanded to cosmic levels.'
