            text: '. Artists were encouraged artists to explore different viewpoints—both literal and metaphorical—through unique compositions, storytelling, or social perspectives. The exhibition highlights how individual identities contribute to and shape a larger communal narrative. Each piece serves as a personal story that, when combined with others, reflects the vast, interconnected fabric of our community. Over 85 artists participated and are on display through September 20th in the Main Gallery. '
