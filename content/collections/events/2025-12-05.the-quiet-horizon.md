From Vermeer’s intimate domestic interiors, where light softly illuminates the traces of life, to Caspar David Friedrich’s landscapes where figures confront the vastness of the unknown, the interplay between presence and void has long inspired artistic reflection.

                text: "Kephira Davis always knew she wanted to be an artist. Growing up in Greenville, South Carolina, she spent afternoons drawing Disney characters and hosting tea parties for her older sisters. Davis’s childhood memories and familial relationships heavily influence her work today. Exploring themes of ancestry, dreams, memory, and where they intersect, Kephira shares the stories she grew up hearing, keeping the past ever present. Surveying her family's history, Kephira presents viewers with past moments that now exist in a realm of memory. She closely examines her place within her family and how the passage of time influences each phase of life. In 2023, Kephira received her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Lander University with a concentration in 2D studio. She continues to develop her interest in her family history and culture as a whole. Kephira uses her experience in curatorial gallery practices and teaching as a Visual Arts instructor in the Greenville County Schools ARMES program, giving students a well-rounded introduction to the visual arts space. Kephira is a Brandon Fellowship alumnus and working studio artist."

                text: 'The journey from childhood to adulthood is filled with both rapid change and great nuance. In my work, I explore the dynamics of familial experiences and the idea of growing up, maturing, and feeling the slow, bittersweet “slipping away” from family as we get older. As I am currently in this transitional period from girlhood to young woman, I ponder the experiences of others in my family. From my childhood memories to stories I have grown up hearing, the need to share these narratives and changes that I notice as time goes on comes naturally. In this way, I preserve my family narrative while writing my own.'

As an analog photographer, Gansauer is drawn to the tactile, intentional nature of film and darkroom printing. His process begins long before the shutter clicks—with slowness, deliberation, and trust in the unseen. Each frame becomes a small collaboration between light and time, almost like painting with light.'

Herren became an artist out of necessity, driven by a need to speak about the earth and the many nuances of life on it. His work is deeply influenced by Indigenous art forms, from pottery and textiles to agriculture and mythology. From these many sources, He has built an eclectic style rooted in color, poetry, and spiritual message. At the heart of his practice is a desire to confront the human condition, believing that art, offered with love and hope, can help shift the world.'

Whether painting, writing, or drawing, Herren aims to express beauty and give shape to the inner feelings that only find their voice through art. My work is both personal growth and spiritual practice, an attempt to reach outward while growing inward. Through art and poetry, he hopes to cultivate a more verdant, compassionate world for himself and for others.'

Creating work in both digital and analog formats, Warren’s skills range from studio and environmental portraits to more personal projects focusing on internal struggles and thoughtful, vulnerable imagery. Much of Warren’s work is done with a 40+ year old view camera, shooting and hand developing 4x5” sheets of film to create confronting images with gritty textures. His work has won multiple accolades, including an Addy award for an At Home Magazine cover in 2018, a purchase award at the Pickens County Museum, a piece in the SEC4P’s juried exhibition ‘The Intimate Portrait’, and recently a portrait for an article in Forbes Magazine. Eli Warren’s fine art work is available through Art & Light Gallery.'

Mostly unaware, we make decisions and manage our identities to tell our personal story, to avoid judgment, or to welcome and make a stand against that judgement. My work is meant to show a break in that cycle. A visualization of the person in a state of detachment from those concerns. A beautiful world is right under the surface where vulnerability is celebrated and imperfections are seen as beautiful. This work is meant to be the defiant scream of a quiet artist to a world intent on covering up what’s just underneath.'
