        text: 'Hans-Peter Bolz always had the desire to become an Artist, even at an early age growing up in post-war Germany. His first-grade teacher recognized his talent and encouraged him to keep painting. Hans-Peter’s formal training consists of a course in commercial art, illustration and design with famous Art school International, Inc. He also attended several workshops in portrait, landscapes, and plein air with some of the best painters in the Carolinas. Hans-Peter prefers to paint in oil. With this medium, you are able “to push the paint around” when working wet on wet.'
