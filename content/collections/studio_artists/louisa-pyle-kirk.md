        text: 'Louisa, a lifelong South Carolinian, discovered her passion for art as a child at the Greenville County Museum of Art, then located in the Gassaway Mansion. She honed her skills through portrait lessons with Bob Bruns but later shifted her focus to Economics in college. After 12 years in Marketing and Information Systems, she pursued a Master of Social Work, leading to a career in counseling. However, her love for art never faded. Returning to the Greenville County Museum of Art, she studied with Carrie Burns Brown, refining her style and confidence. A GCCA studio artist since its inception, Louisa has exhibited in numerous juried shows and continues to balance her work as a social worker with her passion for creating art.'
