        text: 'Kym Easter, based in Travelers Rest, SC, draws inspiration from the natural beauty and wildlife around her. Originally from a large farm in West Virginia, she studied Engineering Design at West Virginia Tech University and earned a teaching degree from West Virginia State, always incorporating art into her studies. Her artistic career began early, with show wins and sales in high school. After moving to South Carolina, she exhibited in nationally juried art fairs, earning multiple Best of Show awards. Passionate about fostering a strong arts community, Kym co-founded the TR Town Art Crawl, served on the Travelers Rest Artists Alliance board, and helped establish WR Fine Art Gallery. She now co-owns Wild Hare Gallery + Studios in Travelers Rest.'
