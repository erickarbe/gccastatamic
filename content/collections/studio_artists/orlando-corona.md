        text: 'Orlando Corona is a Greenville, SC-based artist specializing in painting and printmaking. Born in Guanajuato, Mexico, he moved to the U.S. at age 10, navigating a new world that later shaped his artistic voice. He discovered his passion for art in high school, where he found mentorship in printmaking, launching his journey as a professional artist. Drawing inspiration from his experience as a first-generation Mexican immigrant, Orlandoâ€™s work explores personal narratives while challenging cultural stereotypes. His art serves as a means of storytelling and empowerment, aiming to inspire others and contribute meaningfully to his community and beyond. Despite his relatively recent start, he has quickly established himself as a rising talent in the Upstate art scene.'
