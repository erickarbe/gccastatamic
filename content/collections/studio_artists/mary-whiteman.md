        text: 'Mary Whiteman (Finn), born and raised in Atlanta, GA, specializes in abstract acrylic paintings with mixed mediums such as charcoal and oil pastels. She’s inspired by artists that take risks, such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Salvador Dali, and Kehinde Wiley. She obtained an A.A. in Studio Art, and a B.A. in Interdisciplinary Studies with minors in Education, Psychology, and Sociology. Currently, Mary is pursuing her M.A. in Art Education at the University of Florida, to intersect her passion for the arts with her love for education.'
