        text: 'Darius Ollison’s passion for photography began in college, where he spent hours admiring images on Flickr before picking up a camera. Frustrated by his phone’s limitations in capturing the stunning sunsets of his small college town, he invested in a DSLR, quickly becoming obsessed with improving his craft. After three years of experimenting, he shifted his focus to portrait photography, drawing inspiration from photographers like Stefan Beutler and Andre Josselin. For Darius, the true magic of portraiture lies in the deep connection between photographer and model—those rare moments when creativity flows seamlessly, capturing raw, honest expressions. Through his work, he seeks to reveal glimpses of the soul, making each session an intimate and meaningful experience.'
