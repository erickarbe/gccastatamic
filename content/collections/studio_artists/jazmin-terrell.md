        text: "Jazmin Terrell is a printmaker, painter, textile, and book artist. She originates from Des Moines, Iowa, and grew up on a homestead\_with many creatures. In 2024, she received her BFA in Integrated Studio Arts from Iowa State University and, later that year, moved to Greenville. During her time in university, she discovered her love for printmaking and fine art research. Through her budding career, Jazmin aims to share her passion for education and community. As an instructor, Jazmin fosters an inclusive environment in and around her courses, where collaboration and experimentation are encouraged. Her love of politics and humor stems from reading the Sunday papers as a child and grew into a love for journalism and cartoons. She hopes you can laugh at her art, or at least think it is a bit weird.\_"
