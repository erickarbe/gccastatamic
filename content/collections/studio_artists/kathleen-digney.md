        text: 'Kathleen is a commissioned portrait artist with over 30 years of experience, drawing from a background in oil painting and medical illustration. A graduate of The Cleveland Institute of Art, she studied both medical illustration and portrait painting, tracing her artistic lineage back to masters like Robert Henri, Zorn, Sorolla, and Sargent. Her work is distinguished by a painterly approach in oils and rich detail in colored pencil and mixed media. Kathleen began her career as a medical illustrator for a leading Cleveland research hospital before transitioning fully to portraiture. She now dedicates herself to both painting and teaching, offering private lessons, workshops, and classes through art leagues, museums, and college programs.'
