        text: 'Meghan Verret was born and raised in a small town in Louisiana. She is a proud alumna of McNeese State University, where she earned a B.A. in Psychology. Halfway through graduate school, Meghan had her only child who was diagnosed with Lissencephaly. As his needs grew, she devoted more time to his care, precipitating a need to leave graduate school and eventually the workforce. Meghan and her husband moved to South Carolina with their son, where she was inspired by the active art scene of Greenville to practice a talent she had left behind in high school. Being an artist is both therapeutic and a valuable work opportunity that allows her the time she needs for her family.'
