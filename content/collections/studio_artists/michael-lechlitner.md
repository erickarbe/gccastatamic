        text: 'Michael Lechlitner grew up on a family farm in Northern Indiana, surrounded by a small, safe, rural world. College in the 1970s exposed him to the civil rights movement, Vietnam War veterans, and corporate greed, prompting a deep shift in his worldview. In response, he dedicated the 1980s and 1990s to mentoring and providing housing for young adults. In his 50s, while doing carpentry for an art studio, he was encouraged to take an art class despite past doubts due to partial color blindness. What began as a hobby evolved into a passion, expanding from ink and watercolor to acrylics and metalwork. Today, Michaelâ€™s art reflects his commitment to peace and justice, each piece telling a unique story.'
