        text: "explores human propensity to observe, discover, and then control space, both terrestrial and cosmic. Ana Vizcarra Rankin’s paintings challenge the supposed objectivity of maps, revealing how they reflect power structures and shape our understanding of place. By reimagining erased histories and offering alternative\_perspectives—such as unconventional map orientations and cosmic reinterpretations—she invites viewers to question dominant narratives and consider new ways of seeing. Lindsay Godin’s “Futurisms” photography series examines humanity’s enduring fascination with uncharted territories, from early celestial observations to modern space exploration. Her work highlights how technological advancements—such as telescopes and rockets—extend our reach beyond Earth, transforming observation into an act of possession. By exploring the tension between curiosity and control, “Futurisms” reflects on the relentless human impulse to claim the unknown."
