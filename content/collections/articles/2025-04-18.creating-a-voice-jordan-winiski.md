        text: " first learned about Greenville Center for Creative Arts five years ago when she was a high school student attending the Fine Arts Center.\_ Jordan wanted to get involved in the arts community outside of the classroom so she volunteered to help with the kid’s activity during a First Friday at GCCA and found a place where she could see that people of all ages felt included and supported.\_ Jordan knew that being part of GCCA would help to foster her love of the arts and her desire to teach so she continued to find ways to get involved.\_\_"

        text: "The arts have been important to Jordan for as long as she can remember.\_ For Jordan, art provides a way of thinking, communicating, problem-solving, learning, and expressing herself.\_ Growing up Jordan remembers her gramma taking her to art museums and always having a new package of Model Magic for her to play with. Because Jordan’s family values and appreciates art, she has always felt supported enough to pursue her interest.\_ In addition to family support, Jordan credits amazing art teachers who inspired her and made her want to pursue becoming an artist and an art teacher.\_ She recently graduated from Furman University where she majored in Sustainability Science and Studio Art with a concentration in ceramics.\_\_"

        text: "As a teacher, Jordan hopes to cultivate a community of young artists who are able to discover an artistic voice by bringing their interests to life through visual art.\_ In the classroom, Jordan incorporates experiential activities and community engagement to help students develop a connection to a broader sense of self.\_ She encourages students to consider how pulling from experiences outside of the classroom will impact how they choose to express themselves as artists.\_ Jordan believes that education is critical at all ages and finds that GCCA is unique because it is an organization that provides programs for all ages and skill levels, combines an inclusive vision with community outreach, and fosters a deep commitment to education. As Jordan states, “GCCA is a crucial part of a thriving community that fosters collaboration, student ownership in their work, social activism, personal expression, and overall a lifelong investment in the arts.”"
