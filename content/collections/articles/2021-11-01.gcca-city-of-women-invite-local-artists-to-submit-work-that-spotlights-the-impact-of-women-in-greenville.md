        text: '– Today, many aspects of our communities reflect a history built and created by men. The names of cities, streets, bridges, and buildings; the statues in our parks, the holidays we celebrate. Now, thanks to City of Women Greenville, we can help our community rethink what they know about history and advance the role of women today and in the future.'

        text: '“There is great power in sharing the untold and forgotten stories of the women who helped to build Greenville. It deepens our collective understanding of history, brings to light many unknown contributions, and builds a more inclusive future for all,” explains Elizabeth Davis, President of Furman University, a partner institution of City of Women. “This is why we at Furman University are proud to be a part of City of Women and honor the mission to celebrate, recognize and inspire the women and men of our community. We are especially excited to see this come to life through the expression of our robust artist community at GCCA this March.”'
