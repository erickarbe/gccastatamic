        text: " a new Community Gallery exhibition that showcases the work of seven students from Greenville’s Fine Arts Center as they explore the definition of place. From things like place in society to place in evolution, these advanced young artists have banded together to provide a perspective on how high school students view not only themselves, but the world around them. Sam Barnhart, Grae Beckham, Brianna Bruce, Alex Coffey, Thomas Hicks, Dylan Swain and Katherine Wiedemann are the young artists who will be displaying their individuality through their places in life. After First Friday, the exhibition will be open to visitors Wednesday to Fridays from 1 p.m. - 5 p.m. through June 23.\_"
