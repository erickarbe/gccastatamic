        text: 'In No Detail Too Small, Jordan Winiski and KC Christmas explore the intricacies of life. Jordan Winiski transforms overlooked flora into intricate ceramic dioramas to magnify the dichotomy between what is valued or destroyed. KC Christmas’s flora collages serve as a reminder to pause and reflect. By capturing florals in their bloom, the progress of time is paused in order to observe a moment before it is gone.'
