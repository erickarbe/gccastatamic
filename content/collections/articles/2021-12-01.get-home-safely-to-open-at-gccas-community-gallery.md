My desire is to convey my truth as well as uncover the truth and beauty placed within those that I hold close to my heart.”'

        text: "Malik Greene is a South Carolina-based artist who began creating professionally in 2019 after graduating from Coastal Carolina University with a Bachelors in Psychology. The art practice of Malik Greene is primarily self-taught and art forms such as manga illustration and fashion design helped the artist develop a strong passion for uncovering his truth through his creativity. His works tell the story of his life, his desires and the subtle nuances that may affect the way in which he receives the world. The work of Malik Greene captures his mental state and allows him to stand in the center of his world, his mission is to create what is around him. He captures his personal history through intimate oil and acrylic portraits of family, moments and memories that convey his experience as a Black Man and Black artist alike. The normality of Black subjects within his art conveys a certain power; one that does not rely on pain, trauma and past oppression to propel his artistic vision. He finds strength in his identity, and his art has become his voice to understand himself. Malik uses bold colors, textural brushwork and unique figuration to evoke emotion and emphasis within his work.\_"
