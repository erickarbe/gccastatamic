        text: " and I am a painter and experimental filmmaker from Greenville, South Carolina. Currently, my work explores color theory and how the perception of color can influence society—particularly its cultural connotations related to race, history, and the possibilities it holds for shaping future narratives. My style is inspired by artists like Jean-Michel Basqiuat, Julie Merhutu, and Jadé Fadojutimi. My style balances the essential elements and principles of design with an intentional, layered chaos of hue, creating a visually compelling interplay between order and unpredictability. I gained interest in this organization due to the community it has established. With professional artists, to beginners and kids in the Art School, I knew that I wanted to learn more about what GCCA had to offer, and how it worked behind the scenes. As an artist, living in this community has offered me unique opportunities and allowed me to establish a foundation for my career path. Through this role, I have also gained insight into the business side of the arts, including managing studio rentals, navigating contracts, and developing fundraising strategies. Another medium I’m interested in exploring is glass. Although I haven’t had the opportunity yet due to limited supplies and resources, I’m drawn to its vibrant color and the way it interacts with light—I believe it holds great potential for creating something truly beautiful.\_"

        text: ', and I am a Communications and Studio Art major at Brevard College currently in my junior year. To tell you a little about my backstory, I went to the Fine Arts Center in high school, and quickly found my love for sculpture and metals because of the instruction and materials provided to me. This has transitioned into my career in college as well, with a sculpture concentration. Most of my art is a combination of metals, ceramics, fibers, and found objects. Overall, the work is inspired through my own experiences and emotions, usually utilizing the language of flowers and organic constructions. My most recent pieces have been thought of as “eclectic” in the various exhibitions and publications they have been in, and I am eager to further my exploration of materials and the language of flora through my experiences and gained knowledge. I was drawn to work for GCCA because of my background as an artist, as well as growing up coming to showcases and exhibitions here. I have prior experience working for non profits, and my love for reaching out into the local community and helping people, as well as being an artist myself, led me to pursue a role here. One thing I have discovered about the community here is how diverse it is. GCCA reaches out to so many groups of people through their many programs, so I have been able to converse with artists just starting out in the summer camps, as well as artists who have mastered their style over a lifetime of working and teaching. Everyone comes from a different place, but we all come together to make art here. There are so many pathways that have opened up for me because of learning other people’s stories! '
