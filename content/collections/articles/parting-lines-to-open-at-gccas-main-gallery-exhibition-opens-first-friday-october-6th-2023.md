        text: 'TeaYoun Kim-Kassor''s installation series, "Modulation," delves into the concept of identity and questions the interplay between personal history and migration. Her work speaks to the universal human experience of grappling with questions like "Who am I?" and "Where am I?" as we navigate life''s complexities. Sabre Esler''s art takes a markedly scientific approach, probing the invisible constructs of thoughts. Esler uses color theory to represent abstract ideas. Her "what if" hypotheses serve as a bridge between art and science, resonating with the exhibition''s theme of exploring uncharted territories of the human condition. Mayuko Ono Gray''s graphite drawings offer a unique blend of cultural influences, seamlessly merging traditional Japanese calligraphy with Western drawing practices. Ono Gray’s works capture everyday life experiences and incorporate matching Japanese proverbs, intricately woven into a single, continuous line of hiragana and kanji characters. The calligraphic line symbolizes the journey of life, from birth to death, echoing the overarching theme of the exhibition.'
