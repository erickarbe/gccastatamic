        text: ', artists Charles Geiger, Julia Morrisroe, and Meredith Stoudenmire investigate ideas ranging from narratives associated with monuments & contemporary events to the thrill of adventure. Through abstracted forms, environmental and social issues precipitate to create conversation surrounding our past and our future. Charles Geiger uses abstracted botanical forms in his paintings that merge with social and environmental issues. Julia Morrisroe’s paintings examine the purpose of public monuments and who they served. Through imagery of volcanoes, Meredith Stoudenmire’s paintings explore adventure and risk taking.'

He studied art at East Carolina University and Computer Science at Millersville University. Much of his art is informed by science concepts which are interlaced with current environmental and societal stresses. A recent exhibition of his paintings on climate change at NYU Abu Dhabi, U.A.E. was underwritten in part by the Rachel Carson Center, New York University Arts and Humanities Art & Art History, and eARThumanities.\_"

Morrisroe is a Professor in painting and drawing at University of Florida and serves on the Conference Committee of the College Art Association and the Curatorial Board for 352Walls for the city of Gainesville, FL. Morrisroe’s paintings, drawings, and installations have been exhibited in museums and art galleries worldwide in over 17 solo exhibitions and 90 group exhibitions.\_"
