        text: '“Walt’s Waltz is working to liberate people who wrestle with anxiety and depression from stigma—whether societal, cultural, religious, or personal—that could lead to alienation and suicide,” explains Walt’s Waltz founder Susan Crooks, whose own son, Walt, died by suicide in 2019. “The elimination of stigma will enable community members to ask for help when needed so recovery can begin, hope can be inspired, and tragedies can be avoided.”'

        text: "The Stigma-Free Zone designation from Walt’s Waltz acknowledges GCCA for taking steps to eliminate the stigma associated with mental health conditions. The art center will serve as a safe and welcoming place that allows community members to get the mental health resources they need without judgment. This is vital considering that one in four adults experiences a mental health condition within their lifetime, and many do not seek help because they fear shame or judgment from those around them.\_"

        text: '“This is a cause that is close to our hearts because we know many creative individuals whose lives have been impacted by mental health challenges,” says Kim Fabian, GCCA’s executive director. “Through this designation, GCCA will have the opportunity to offer effective ways to reduce the stigma and encourage those who are affected to seek services and support. We hope this will raise awareness of local resources so no one within our community needs to feel hopeless or alone.”'

        text: "As part of the First Friday activities, GCCA Brandon Fellow alumnus Nicks Burns will exhibit an 8’x8’ portrait of Walt Crooks. Attendees will also have the opportunity to contribute to a large community art project. Participants will add handwritten words of hope, empowerment, and compassion, as well as an adjective that describes the feeling a person might experience when faced with mental health stigma.\_These words will be burned into a large piece of wood as a permanent reminder\_that speaking out reduces shame. This artwork will then be used and displayed in the state’s future Stigma-Free Zones."
