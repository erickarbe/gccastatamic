Kim won the distinction of being the only student ever to have received first place in three consecutive undergraduate juried exhibitions at Winthrop University Galleries. She is a mixed media artist who uses her art to explore the abject adolescent feminine psyche. Working in a variety of mediums, her goal is to decontextualize objects of feminine consumerism to explore the \"true\" and \"false\" self as it relates to repressed violence, aggression, and abjection in the female mind.\_"
