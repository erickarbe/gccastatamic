        text: 'Elizabeth Kinney’s solo exhibition showcases large-scale paintings and charcoal drawings. Elizabeth, a muralist, captures strange, beautiful, and comforting moments through the use of intense colors and finds inspiration from the community around her. She has been working in mixed media since 1994, with a focus on portraits, murals, and paintings. She currently has work on display at Hotel Domestique, and Restaurant 17. You might see some of her murals around Greenville and Travelers Rest if you ever bike the trail, wander the neighborhoods, or listen to Music in the Park.'
