        text: 'Zach Suggs is a career photographer based in Greenville, South Carolina. Growing up with a heart that roamed elsewhere, rambling trips with friends growing up became earnest searches for a place to call home out west. Each time he left he found himself tethered to Appalachia. He has partnered with brands and agencies such as Shakespeare Fishing, Hodgman Waders, BF Goodrich, Liquid Wrench, and Brains on Fire, and organizations such as Great Outdoor Adventure Trips, and The Family Effect. Since 2017 he has worked closely with the BMW Car Club of America Foundation archiving BMW’s automotive history through exhibition catalogs of four award-winning CCA Foundation Museum exhibitions. Zach photographed musician Nikki Lane for a limited edition picture disc vinyl for her ‘Highway Queen’ album, and most recently he was the recipient of the Greenville Metropolitan Arts Council individual artist grant for his solo exhibition, “A Well-Worn Path.”'
