        text: "Join us at GCCA on First Friday, September 1st from 6-9pm for the opening of our newest Community Gallery exhibition, Rural Carolina Revisited. This exhibition showcases over 30 watercolor paintings of Pat Konicki and looks at conjunctions of beauty and antiquity of rural life in the Carolinas. Changing the perceptions of overlooked subjects is at the core of Konicki's work. Subjects such as dilapidated barns or broken down cars hold intrinsic beauty and Konicki explores that idea by enhancing color and light. Konicki's work provokes an emotional response to a place or thing, thus highlighting the value in protecting or restoring the environment around us in the Carolinas. The challenge is to see beyond the surface of the decay and capture its splendor and history."
