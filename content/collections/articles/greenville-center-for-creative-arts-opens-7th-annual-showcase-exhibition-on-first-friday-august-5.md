        text: "The 2021-2022 Brandon Fellowship exhibition will also be on display with work by emerging artists Kim Le, Sienna Patterson, and Terrell Washington. Kim Le’s work comes from the ugly, wounded and abject parts of a young girl’s psyche, reappropriating the common language of cuteness that little girls use to cope with their pain to connect to the furious and wretched spirit of young girls and women everywhere who’ve been beaten down by the world around them. Through expressive imagery and journal entries, Sienna Patterson explores the concept of the fool's journey through the lens of her personal experiences. Terrell Washington’s “Genesis: Omens and Decisions of Existence”, depicts the realness of prayer, our blessings and curses, human nature, all while highlighting people of melanin at the center of his work. In addition, after a competitive selection process, GCCA will announce the three new Brandon Fellows for the upcoming 2022-2023 program year."
