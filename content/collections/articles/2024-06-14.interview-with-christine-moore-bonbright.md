        text: 'Ben Tarcson, Gallery Director: Christine, I have had the pleasure of getting to know you as an artist over the past year, and you first came to the program as a traditional pen & ink / charcoal drawing artist. It now seems, roughly ¾ into the Fellowship, that you have changed course a bit. Has the Brandon Fellowship program given you the opportunity to adjust the trajectory of your art career? And how are you making art differently than when you entered?'

        text: 'So when I first entered the Fellowship, I had thought that I needed to continue creating the traditional drawing & painting works that I made in college. Those works I made in college were deeply personal to me and they touched on things like family, culture, and identity struggles. I think at first I felt a pressure from within and also an external pressure from my cultural community that I should or I have to continue making those works because I need to represent the communities that I belong to. I felt that pressure a lot and in the early months of the Fellowship, that led to some artistic stagnation and indecision. But as I came to be surrounded by the artists at GCCA, meeting with you and Brandon Fellow alumni, and participating in mentor critique meetings, it made me realize that I really should just create the art that I want. So I asked myself, what does my artistic trajectory actually look like?'

        text: 'While I still love traditional art like drawing with charcoal and it’s fantastic to have those technical skills from that medium, I found it isn’t the medium that will take me to where I want to go. Digital art really is the medium that I am most comfortable with, and I feel like where I create the best art that represents me and my experiences. I think I definitely see myself now, especially as sort of a representative of the digital art community here in Greenville.'

        text: 'A turning point of me wanting to move more into digital painting, character design, and comic work was when I was introduced to my mentor, Honie Beam. After working with her, honing in on what it is I want to accomplish, and getting endlessly fruitful feedback about my process, I felt comfortable doubling down on my new path. And I definitely think that my trajectory and the fellowship would have been different if stuck to my original plan in my traditional mediums, as I probably would have taken the time allotted to me through the Fellowship to explore another facet of my art identity.'

Each Fellow gains access to critical, professional advice and networking opportunities from a mentor group of professional artists that are hand-picked each year to specifically meet the needs of that year’s Fellowship class. How important is having a community of support as you explore the themes and mediums you want?'

        text: 'After I moved to Greenville back in 2022, I very much felt isolated as an artist. I actually came to the 2022 Annual Showcase on a whim and was pleasantly surprised that a program like the Brandon Fellowship was being offered so I decided to apply the following year. The power of finding my community can not be understated. Not only having the professional support through connections I have made but more important are the friends that I have made through this process. Connecting with Brandon Fellow alumni and the GCCA community has created an atmosphere of belonging for me which has only emboldened my purpose as an emerging artist.'

        text: 'It was also a fun process to work with you to hand pick the mentors we wanted for our Fellowship year. Honie seemed like the ideal mentor for me as she has experience with art & literary agencies, and obviously creating amazing works of art of her own. I told myself that I have this opportunity right here to have a mentor that is literally doing what I want to do in the future, creating illustrative, agency work, and graphic novels. I did not want to waste any time and I made sure I would soak up as much information as possible. We do get to meet during our critiques sessions that we have quarterly with the other Fellows and mentors, but I make an effort to meet and talk with Honie as often as I can. For instance, we met for coffee some months back and she basically sat down with a huge binder of her entire catalog of comic work and files and was like, “So, here’s how I got my agent. Here’s the difference between an art agent and a literary agent. You know, here’s the contracts and how they work, etc”. It was eye opening to have the opportunity to see what it was like to be a contracted, professional illustrator, and what that path may look like for me. It was really important to me to gain those insights so that I can set realistic expectations for myself and hopefully get my foot in the door after the Fellowship.'

        text: "Right now, I am in the throes of working on my first graphic novel, “Black Sheep”. This is the project I have been working on for some time now but chose this story for my fellowship work because it is heavily character focused and I have always been drawn to character design. I wanted to see my experience represented in the digital and printed mediums. Each of the characters in this story have bits of myself expressed in their design and personality. “Black Sheep” is really a coming of age story. It explores how, in those early stages of our lives, we often attempt to escape from difficult situations. It is scary to confront difficult issues at any age but especially so in those formative years of our lives.\_Maybe it’s unrequited love that isn’t fulfilled and accepting that you need to let go. Maybe it’s feeling the stress of not having solid career plans after school. It also delves into parental figures impacting how you see yourself and how you subsequently navigate the world."

        text: 'The first of my inspirations obviously came from the internet. The main inspiration for my work comes from a comic series called “Backlash” by Amber Houston. I have been following it since it began back in 2014 and I was intrigued by the female characters not fitting into traditional female archetypes. Their identity was not centered on traditional roles females occupy in adventure stories and that really resonated with me and where my stories and artwork could go. Other than Amber Houston, I would say my digital painting style has been influenced by Sui Ishidia and the “Toyko Ghoul” series and the character designs of Tas Mukanik.'

To give additional context, I will be printing character reference sheets, digital illustration, concept art, and the cover of the comic as large format fine art prints. I will also be displaying a spread of sketches, scripts, and thumbnails that show the editorial process with my mentor, Honie Beam.'

While I was writing the whole plot out, I was like, oh, my gosh, this is a much more complicated story than when I started. So I think moving forward, I definitely want to experiment with maybe shorter stories or maybe an adaptation of something that already exists to experiment with graphic novel work. I’ve also been considering getting into agency work, but I might start off with freelance opportunities in illustration, character design.'
