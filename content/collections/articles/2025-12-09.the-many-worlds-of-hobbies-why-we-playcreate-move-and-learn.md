        text: 'Hobbies aren’t just distractions — they’re the syntax of joy. In a world built on optimization, hobbies remind us that time spent “unproductively” can be the most productive of all. Whether you’re learning, lifting, writing, or wandering — it’s the act of engaging that makes life vivid. So, pick one. Start small. Repeat often. Your future self will thank you.'
