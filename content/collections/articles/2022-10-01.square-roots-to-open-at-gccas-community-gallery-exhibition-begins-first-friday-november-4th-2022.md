        text: ", Sarkis Chorbadjian showcases square-formatted paintings that explore the application and removal of oil & cold wax layers. For Sarkis, scratching large, square painting surfaces to their roots reveals an emotional significance that is a product of the process in which he works. His abstract landscape paintings are personal responses to places he has visited or imagined. The viewer is invited to travel with the artist, to feel and sense the memories, and to discover new ones.\_"
