        text: 'For over 25 years, artist Steve Courchaine has traveled throughout the American West, collecting reference material with photography and practicing plein air painting. Inspired by the vast western landscape, he observed the clarity of sunlight in the west increases the color saturation found in nature there versus what you might see in the east. This exhibit represents those experiences.'
