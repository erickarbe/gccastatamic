        text: "Greenville Center for Creative Arts (GCCA) will begin accepting applications for its annual emerging young artist program, the Brandon Fellowship, on Friday, June 3, 2022. This 12-month program aims to develop three emerging artists between the ages of 21 to 30 who represent the diversity of the Greenville community. Those selected receive free studio space, a stipend for supplies, a supportive environment, mentorship, and complimentary art education for one full year. Through this unique opportunity for young creative arts professionals, Fellowship alumni have established themselves as full-time working artists, designers, graduate students, artists-in-residence, instructors, published artists, grant recipients, and award winners.\_"
