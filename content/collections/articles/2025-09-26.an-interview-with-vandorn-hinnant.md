        text: ' Vandorn described this as a “tricky proposition.” At five, he was already searching for ways to record dreams and memories. By twelve, he was painting abstractions, attempting to capture the eyes of the soul. Supported by his mother, a first-generation college student who made sure her children had access to books and art supplies, he pursued painting seriously and has never stopped.'

        text: 'In college, his professor Ben Burns urged him to abandon abstraction in favor of realism, but Vandorn continued on his own path. Ironically, Burns later gained recognition for abstract work. In his early twenties, Vandorn held a solo exhibition in downtown Greensboro and became immersed in what he calls “creative response,” creating in the moment without regard for who came before or beside him.'

        text: ' He calls his work “abstraction but not abstraction,” or metaphysical realism. His paintings and sculptures seek to capture realities not always accessible to others. In the mid-1980s he began hearing music that did not exist in the physical world, and his art became a way of visually recording those sounds. Though he began with painting, he eventually transitioned into sculpture to pursue this dimensionality more fully.'
