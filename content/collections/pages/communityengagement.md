            text: 'Students in the Aspiring Artists After-School Program will explore a different artistic medium and theme each month through hands-on workshops designed to build creative confidence, self-expression, and problem-solving skills. Aligned with state educational standards, these sessions foster empathy, community pride, and personal growth.Workshops may include painting, drawing, illustration, textiles, sculpture, jewelry-making, or printmaking. Teaching artists, selected for their expertise and cultural diversity, will guide students in age-appropriate techniques, encouraging experimentation and artistic exploration beyond what they encounter in school.As a culminating event, GCCA will host a student exhibition in the Gray Loft, inviting families to celebrate their work. Featured during GCCA’s First Friday receptions recognizing students’ achievements and reinforcing the impact of the program.'
