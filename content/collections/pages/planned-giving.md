        text: 'Your planned gift will likely be larger than any gift you could make during your lifetime. The Masterpiece Society allows us to recognize your generosity now, for the incredible gift you will make later. You will keep control over your bequest assets should you need them during your lifetime, and you may modify your gift at any time, should your circumstances or desires change.'
