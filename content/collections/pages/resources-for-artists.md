        text: 'GCCA supports working visual artists in many ways, including providing studio spaces for rent at affordable rates. Artists working in visual art mediums such as drawing/illustration, digital art, encaustics, fiber arts/textiles, jewelry, mixed media/collage, painting, photography, and printmaking may apply for a studio. We currently do not have studios for ceramics, woodworking, glass, or metalworking.'

        text: 'Although a minimum number of hours is not required, GCCA studios are intended for working artists so we request that artists spend time working in their studios a few days each week, as well as participate in First Fridays and fundraising events. Patrons visiting GCCA are eager to see works-in-progress and are interested in purchasing art!'
