        text: 'GCCA began with a mission to foster and serve the Greenville community. We believe that passion, skill, and dedication – not financial circumstance – should drive community access to the arts. From workshops and lecture series, to youth scholarship programs and exhibition opportunities, we are continuously seeking new ways to educate and inspire children and adults alike – while providing opportunity and outreach for those in need.'
