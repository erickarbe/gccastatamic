This space is perfect for any midsize event or photography needs. The space is located on the second floor of our building above our reception area and conference room. Mobile walls are available for use as well as cocktail tables and linens for an additional fee. Light food and beverage can be coordinated by an outside vendor but no onsite catering services are provided at this time and serving tables must be set up just outside of the Loft doors.'

The room is equipped with moveable tables and chairs that can be easily configured to accommodate the needs of guests. Light food and beverage can be coordinated by an outside vendor but no onsite catering services are provided at this time. The walls of the Conference Room display historic pictures of the Brandon Mill and Village of West Greenville where GCCA is located. This space can be rented in conjunction with our Main Gallery space to provide more room for spreading out.'

Towards the back of the Gallery is what is known as our classroom area. This area is equipped with large rolling tables that can be used for buffet-style food and beverage displays. However, due to the delicate nature of some of our art exhibitions, there may be additional limitations for events in this area as guests will be surrounded by art and must be mindful of such.'
