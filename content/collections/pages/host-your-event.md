Mobile walls are available for use as well as cocktail tables and linens for an additional fee. Light food and beverage can be coordinated by an outside vendor but no onsite catering services are provided at this time and serving tables must be set up just outside of the Loft doors.'

Towards the back of the Gallery is what is known as our classroom area. This area is equipped with large rolling tables that can be used for buffet-style food and beverage displays. However, due to the delicate nature of some of our art exhibitions, there may be additional limitations for events in this area as guests will be surrounded by art and must be mindful of such.'
