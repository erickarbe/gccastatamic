            text: 'The Art with an Impact program is a transformative visual arts initiative created through a partnership between Greenville Center for Creative Arts (GCCA) and Perry Correctional Facility, designed to provide incarcerated individuals—particularly those serving life sentences—with meaningful opportunities for creative expression and personal growth. Aligned with GCCA’s mission to ignite creativity, foster empathy, and expand arts access, this program offers high-quality, hands-on visual arts instruction led by local professional teaching artists. Research shows that arts engagement in correctional settings promotes emotional well-being, reduces behavioral infractions, and lowers recidivism rates, and Art with an Impact aims to harness these benefits by offering a constructive outlet for self-expression and reflection. Looking ahead, the program seeks to grow its impact by incorporating visual art therapy, further supporting participants’ mental health and rehabilitation. Through this initiative, GCCA and Perry Correctional Facility are breaking down barriers to creative access and using the transformative power of art to inspire hope and healing.'
