Successful course proposals complement but don’t compete with what’s already on our schedule. We don’t always have room to bring on new instructors, but we always enjoy meeting new artists, and at the very least, we’ll keep your proposal on file. Once submitted, we will review your proposal and contact you if we need more information or would like to discuss your proposal further.'
